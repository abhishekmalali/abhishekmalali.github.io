## Abhishek Malali

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

I am currently a Data Scientist at Tribe Dynamics. My role focuses on finding data driven stories in the realm of Social media marketing. I also lead efforts at the Tribe to integrate NLP and Image processing for classification tasks which bring more value to our customers.

Prior to my current stint at Tribe, I was a Masters student in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University. My masterâ€™s thesis applies LSTM backed models to irregular time series in Astronomy and reduced autocorrelation within residuals. I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from NITK Surathkal, India and submitted a thesis for epilepsy prediction with Intra-Ictal EEG time series data.

## Research Interest

I am primarily interested in applying Machine learning techniques in a robust and scalable manner to a variety of problems. My previous research experiences have spanned from applying classical time series methods to deep learning to problems in vastly different domains. I am particularly interested in image and time series problems which are applied to noisy real world data. I am interested in understanding the effect of noise and the complications brought forward by such datasets. Previously I have handled noisy datasets in astronomy and medical research.
